# Itemized Product Backlog   

Your presentation and live demo combo should last for no more than 15 minutes,
with each team member showcasing their particular feature set and how it ties
into the business needs as a whole.

From Visualforce to Lightning, taking on new iterations of an existing project 
and migrating from Visualforce pages to an SPA using Lightning Aura components.

As a part of this project, you team will collaborate on your groups assigned P1 as the base, 
and expand upon its behind the scenes features with a customer facing experience cloud site 
that utilizes an Aura SPA. Each member of the team will be responsible for at minimum:

User Story 4: Testing coverage for the Apex used.<br>
User Story 5: Any additional declarative customization required to support the features.<br>

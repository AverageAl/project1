1: Visualforce page(s) contains some feature relevant to business

2: Apex controller or controller extension for said feature 

3: Testing coverage for the Apex used

4: Any additional declarative customization required to support feature

Other requirements:

5: Documented SDLC practices using Scrumban

6: Whole project on repository with good branching

7: Cloud site has uniform styling/branding (using CSS, SLDS, HTML, VisualForce)

8: Live demo includes
  (1) clone the master branch of your repo;
  (2) push the customization to a fresh org
